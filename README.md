# Repository Setup

Hello! This is the landing page for a project that I created as a final assignment for the Stat 301-2 class at Northwestern University. My name is Alex Boyko, and I am a sophomore at Northwestern studying statistics. This project is the process of testing and assessing a model with the intention of predicting run/pass calls from the 2023 NFL regular season. All data comes from the `nflverse` package.

This repository is split into six separate subdirectory folders â€” `data`, `memos`, `plots`, `recipes`, `results`, and `scripts` in addition to this file, the .gitignore, and the final project report and executive summary above.

## Data
As mentioned above, the data for this project comes from `nflverse` and can be loaded using the packages' built in functions. Inside the data folder, there are three subfolders containing the raw data as it was retrieved, the cleaned data used in the modeling process, and the various files used to fit and assess the models. These include the resamples, or folds, and the training and testing set.

## Memos
As part of this assignment, two progress memos were assigned to ensure the project was moving along throughout the time frame of the course. Those two memos, and the tables and graphs used in them, are stored in this folder.

## Plots
During the initial exploratory stages of the project and after the modeling had been completed, graphs were made to gain insight about certain variables or explore relationships for the final report. All of those files have been saved in this folder.

## Recipes
In total, six different recipes, or methods in which the data was prepared after cleaning to be input into a model, were used for this project. Those labelled 'standard' refer to the coach recipe type as detailed in the lab report and those labelled 'full' correspond to the computer type.

## Results
Throughout this project, files were created to be used later in the process or to be shown during the final report. These include model fits, specific predictions, tables of result metrics, and other miscellaneous items.

## Scripts
All of the workings and code necessary to complete this assignment were done in the R scripts within this folder. These scripts are numbered and labelled to show the order in which they were finished and the tasks which were completed in them.
